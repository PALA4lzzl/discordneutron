# What is Enhanced discord ?
Enhanced discord is a theme meant to improve your experience. Enhanced Discord is made to be highly customizable and even more compact. The theme has been updated to support Discord's lastests updates, I also made a few fixes just an hour later! You can easily change the theme's colors using HEX or RGB.
